# PDF Generation API Notes

## PDFGenerationController Improvements

### User Feedback for PDF Generation

1. **Detailed Error Messages**
   - Provide more specific error messages for model binding failures
   - Add validation for incoming data structure against expected model structure
   - Include template-specific validation requirements in error responses

2. **Data Model Visualization**
   - Offer an endpoint to view the expected data model structure for a specific template
   - Provide sample JSON for each available template
   - Show validation rules for specific template fields

3. **Request Tracing**
   - Include request IDs in responses for better tracking
   - Provide detailed logs that can be accessed for troubleshooting
   - Implement correlation IDs between related requests

5. **Model Type Handling**
   - Enhance error messages for model type mismatches
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for data that doesn't exactly match the model but could be converted
   - Offer suggestions for correct data structure when model binding fails


## HealthCheckController Enhancements

### Additional Health Metrics

1. **Template Health**
   - Track template validation status (each template was last tested when)
   - Monitor template usage statistics (most/least used templates)
   - Report on template rendering performance (average rendering time per template)
   - Report on problematic templates with high failure rates

2. **System Resource Monitoring**
   - Track CPU usage over time, not just memory
   - Monitor disk space available for PDF storage
   - Track network bandwidth usage for PDF delivery
   - Add thread pool utilization metrics

3. **Service Dependencies**
   - Add health status for RazorService
   - Add health status for iText PDF generation components
   - Monitor external dependencies (if any)
   - Include database connection status (if applicable)

4. **Operational Insights**
   - Add rate limiting statistics
   - Track API usage patterns by endpoint and template

5. **Alerting Thresholds**
   - Define healthy/warning/critical thresholds for key metrics
   - Track error rate percentages, not just absolute counts
   - Monitor response time degradation
   - Track queue depths for pending PDF generation requests

6. **Detailed Error Analysis**
   - Categorize errors by type (template errors, data errors, system errors)
   - Provide error trend analysis
   - Include stack trace accessibility for recent errors
   - Track error resolution status

## ServiceHealthStatus Model Improvements

1. **Enhanced Metrics**
   - Add `CpuUsage` property to track CPU utilization
   - Add `AverageResponseTime` for performance tracking
   - Include `ConcurrentRequestsHandled` for load monitoring

2. **Dependency Status**
   - Add `DependencyStatuses` collection for tracking external service health
   - Add `RazorServiceStatus` specifically for template rendering health

3. **Template Insights**
   - Add `TemplatePerformance` to track rendering times by template
   - Add `TemplateUsageStatistics` to track usage patterns

5. **Operational Status**
   - Add `ServiceVersion` for tracking
